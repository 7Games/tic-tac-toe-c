# Tic-Tac-Toe
But in C

---------

### What is this?
It's Tic-Tac-Toe... but I made it in C... for the terminal.

It uses [termios](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/termios.3.html) to get character input from the terminal without having to press enter.

### How to play?
Use W, A, S, and D to move the cursor around and then press SPACE to place the token.

There is no AI so you have to play with someone else.
